Data preparation: Collect a dataset of stop sign images, and split it into training, validation,
and test sets.

Model selection: Choose a pre-trained model that is suitable for image classification,
such as ResNet, VGG, or Inception.

Model fine-tuning: Fine-tune the pre-trained model on the stop sign dataset using transfer learning.
This involves freezing the initial layers of the model and training the remaining layers using the stop sign data.

Adversarial attack generation: Generate adversarial examples using common attack methods,
such as FGSM, DeepFool, or CW.

Defense evaluation: Evaluate the defense effectiveness of the fine-tuned model using
adversarial examples generated in the previous step.

Defense enhancement: Enhance the defense effectiveness by adding additional layers or
modules to the model, such as adversarial training, feature squeezing, or input transformations.

Repeat steps 5-6 until a robust defense is achieved.

Test and evaluate: Test the final defense model on a test set of stop sign images,
including both clean and adversarial examples, to evaluate its performance.

Deployment: Deploy the final defense model in a real-world environment to protect
against adversarial example attacks on stop sign images.
